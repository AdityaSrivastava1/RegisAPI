why we use routes?

ans->We use routes in Node.js to define how the server should respond
 to different types of client requests (like accessing a webpage or submitting a form) 
 by directing them to specific functions or handlers.

 if there is any resueast in which initial is repeating then with the help of 
 routes we can remove them 
 router.get("/users/all",async (req,res)=>{
     router.get("/users/userid",async (req,res)=>{

so we can remove users by using app.use("/users",userRouter);
